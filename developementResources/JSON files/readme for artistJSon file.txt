JSX (engine that React Native runs on) does not allow for local dynamic urls, and therefor the images used for the app must come from
a web based url

therefore when entering a new artist into the artists.json file, it is imperitive that you find the artists images online and place that image's URL inside imageURL attribute
for the image's corresponding object

this is of course only relevant in the early developement/prototyping stage, as this is simply a basic prototype

for the early stages i have only used famouse renaissance artists and have therefore used the URLs for the paintings that are on their wikipedia pages
